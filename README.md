## About me
Software Engineer having experience in developing web applications using Microservices (Java, SpringBoot), Message Brokers (RabbitMQ, Kafka), Caching Systems (Redis), Search Engine (Elasticsearch), and Distributed Systems. Now, I'm learning React for the front end as part of a personal project.

## Work History
- In recent roles, I've worked on improving containerized applications using Java, focusing on adding features and optimizing performance. I also support junior developers, help with code reviews, and lead projects to speed up bug fixes.
- In past roles, I contributed to creating and enhancing APIs for SaaS applications, deploying them on cloud platforms, and making microservices communicate more efficiently. Throughout my career, I've aimed for practical solutions, like improving data access methods, making software faster, and learning about various technologies.

## Dev Diaries
- I dedicate my free time to learning new technologies & create apps that automate everyday tasks, making life more efficient through technology. Currently, I'm engaged in a household project [programmed-household](https://github.com/srinageswari/programmed-household) focused on programming to simplify inventory management and meal planning.
